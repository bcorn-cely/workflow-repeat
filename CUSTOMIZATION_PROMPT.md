## Step-by-Step Customization Process

### Step 1: Replace Customer Name Throughout the Codebase

The current customer is **"newfront"** (case-sensitive). You need to replace it with your customer name in:

#### 1.1 Directory Structure

**Create new customer directories:**
```bash
# Workflows
workflows/{customer}/{workflow-name}/

# API Routes
app/api/chat/{customer}/
app/api/workflows/{customer}/
app/api/mocks/{customer}/

# Pages
app/{customer}/

# Components
components/{customer}/
```

**Example:** If customer is "acme", create:
- `workflows/acme/contract-management/`
- `app/api/chat/acme/`
- `app/acme/contracts/`
- `components/acme/contract-chatbot.tsx`

#### 1.2 File Contents

Search and replace `newfront` → `{customer}` in:
- Import paths
- API route paths
- Component names
- Workflow references
- Database queries (if customer-specific)

**Files to update:**
- `next.config.ts` - Redirect destination
- All files in `workflows/{customer}/`

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Start with the Agent**: The system prompt is the most important customization. Get this right first.

2. **Preserve Patterns**: Don't reinvent the wheel. The ToolLoopAgent, workflow hooks, and AI Gateway patterns are proven—keep them.

3. **Incremental Changes**: Make changes incrementally and test as you go. Start with customer name replacement, then workflow content, then UI.

4. **Model Routing Strategy**: Document your model routing strategy clearly:
   - Which tasks use cheap models? (extraction, validation, simple queries)
   - Which tasks use premium models? (complex reasoning, generation, analysis)

5. **Persona Design**: Clearly define what each persona can and cannot do. This is crucial for guardrails.

6. **Workflow Steps**: Map out your workflow steps before coding. Consider:
   - Where are approval checkpoints?
   - What steps can run in parallel?
   - What steps need sequential execution?
   - What are the error scenarios?

7. **Testing Workflows**: Test approval flows thoroughly—they're the most complex part.

8. **Documentation**: Update code comments to reflect your use case, not the original demo.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't remove ToolLoopAgent**: It's the core pattern for this demo.
2. **Don't remove AI Gateway integration**: It's a key feature being demonstrated.
3. **Don't remove workflow hooks**: They enable human-in-the-loop approvals.
4. **Don't change message persistence structure**: Unless you have a specific reason.
5. **Don't forget to update all references**: Use find/replace, but verify manually.
6. **Don't skip the system prompt**: It's the most important customization.

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the original code**: The Newfront example is a working reference.
2. **Verify imports**: Make sure all import paths are updated.
3. **Check API routes**: Ensure route paths match your directory structure.
4. **Review workflow hooks**: Approval flows are complex—trace through the code.
5. **Test incrementally**: Don't try to change everything at once.

## Final Notes

This demo is designed to showcase Vercel AI Gateway and Workflows capabilities. When customizing:

- **Keep the technical patterns** (ToolLoopAgent, workflows, hooks, AI Gateway)
- **Change the content** (prompts, terminology, workflows, UI)
- **Preserve the functionality** (model routing, approvals, persistence, streaming)

The goal is to show how these technologies work in a real-world scenario, adapted to your customer's domain and use case.

Good luck with your customization! 🚀
